# About Me

## My Interests
I Like watching soccer.
I take time to take a long walk at least once a week.
I love the fall and winter.
I enjoy programming because it's challenging.

## Websites I recommend
[Slidesgo](https://www.slidesgo.com) - I used slidesGo a ton back in highschool. It lets you find templates that match your topic and you can then upload them into a powerpoint or googleslides.
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is a must have for me because it has everything from education, to comedy, to sadness. It lets me see the world in different perspectives.
